abstract={Rheometers have made giant leaps in terms of usability, sensitivity, and versatility. This leads to the illusion that a rheometer can be used as a fool-proof device for measuring rheological properties. The article will focus on typical problems that are encountered in rheological practice when measuring polymer melts. Emphasis is put on problems related to measurement artefacts stemming from the rheometer as well as from the material itself. Furthermore, possibilities to eliminate rheometer related artefacts mostly related to the following phenomena - geometry inertia, thermal expansion, torque resolution, and environmental control - will be discussed. The sample related artefacts vary significantly from sample to sample and include: thermal degradation, nonlinear shear deformation, centrifugal forces, slip and shear banding, as well as miscibility, orientation, and distribution of different phases, of which only the ones occurring in homogeneous polymer melts are discussed here.},

title = {Errors in parallel-plate and cone-plate rheometer measurements due to sample underfill},
journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
abstract = {The effect of sample underfill on parallel-plate and cone-plate rheometers is examined. Sample underfill can be caused by incomplete filling of a sample or loss of fluid during a test by, for example, evaporation. It is shown that even a small degree of sample underfill can lead to significant errors in measuring viscosity. A method is proposed to reduce these errors by directly monitoring the sample radius over the full course of the test. It is shown that the accuracy of the rheometer even while testing simple fluids like water is greatly improved.}
